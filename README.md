# Hack-the-Earth-2021
The Unity code for my submission for Hack the Earth 2021. 

Build the Unity project for PC, Mac, and Linux Standalone. 

Everything in this repository should be placed in the Assests folder of a Unity project. 

Then just open the SampleScene and press play!

Left click to eliminate enemies and invaders. 
Right click to pass through information and text.

If the forest becomes cleared, then use left click to respawn.
